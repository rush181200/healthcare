Introduction
The main aim of healthcare management is to ensure that hospital facilities run efficiently and effectively in order to provide high-quality patient care. The system will be one centralized place where all the data about the patient will be stored. Healthcare management systems can help hospitals achieve these goals by streamlining processes, reducing errors, and improving overall efficiency.

Motivation
Problems with current solutions in the market
Many health care providers still use their own local physical servers to store and manage the data. 
With increasing number of patients it became difficult to manage the server load and looking after the scaling , provisioning and maintenance of server became a headache.  
For example during Covid, the number of patients entering the hospitals had increased drastically and there was sudden impact on the healthcare systems like servers were overloaded and crashing

Why Serverless?
With serverless architecture we do not need to worry about the increasing number of patients as it can automatically scale resources in response to changing demands. Also using this approach we can deploy and run the application without worrying about the underlying architecture
Serverless architecture will be cost effective as it will eliminate the need for infrastructure and servers and reduce the cost of maintenance and deployment
Also, this architecture will make the system more secure as we can leverage the security features and capabilities of cloud providers. So, we can ensure that critical data about the patient is secured
Hence using a serverless architecture we can overall enhance the health care system and provide the organizations a good experience and better patient care and we can fulfil various requirements of the healthcare industry!
